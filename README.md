Use paper as a game controller

Installation:
=============
1. Clone the repo on your computer.
2. cd to the `server` folder and run `npm install`
3. Install Arduino SDK for your system.
4. Make the connections as per the diagram (to be added soon).

*NOTE: The code as-is runs only on Windows. For making it run on other systems, one will have to change the address of the serial port to which the board is connected (/server/server.js)*

Working:
======

The basic principle behind the project is that the human body is a conductor of electricity - not a very good conductor, but conductor nevertheless. (More explanation to be added soon).
